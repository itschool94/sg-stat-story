Adjust text alignment with the following utility classes. Text is aligned left by default.

To adjust text alignment at a specified breakpoint, use the format `-text-{direction}-{breakpoint}`.

`{direction}` can be:

* `left`
* `center`
* `right`

{breakpoint} can be:

* `xs`
* `sm`
* `md`
* `lg`
* `xl`

Breakpoint-specific classes cascade downwards.
